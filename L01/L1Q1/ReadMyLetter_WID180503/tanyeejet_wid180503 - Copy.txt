My name is Tan Yee Jet with matrix number, WID180503. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling pretty good about taking this subject. This is because I get to understand further how the computer's internal memory works when I run my programs.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. Not good either. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term to make it up for the last one. In order to do well in the subject, I will spend at least an hour contributing to GitHub every day, either towards codes or documentations. Wish me luck!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I performed pretty well in the class. I am quite happy with my performance. Learning DS has let me better understand how data are organized in computer memories. There has been no change to my target grade. I think writing clean codes and stating explanations for each function using comments was the part I did well during the course. I wish our lecturers had a better command of english and that UM could let students sign their attndance using QR codes so that the course could be done better.
